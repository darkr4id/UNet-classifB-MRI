Brain MRI Image Segmentation with U-Net for Lower Grade Glioma Detection
This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a U-Net model for brain MRI image segmentation to classify the presence of lower grade gliomas. The primary objective is to distinguish MRI scans based on whether they show evidence of lower grade gliomas, a type of brain tumor.

Key Features:
Model: U-Net architecture, widely used for biomedical image segmentation, tailored for precise detection and classification of brain structures.
Data: Brain MRI images labeled to indicate the presence or absence of lower grade gliomas.
Objective: Segment brain MRI images and accurately classify the presence of lower grade gliomas, aiding in early detection and diagnosis.
Highlights:
Preprocessing steps, including resizing and normalization, to enhance model performance.
Model Training using the U-Net architecture with optimized hyperparameters to achieve effective segmentation results.
Results: Achieves notable accuracy in identifying lower grade gliomas, demonstrating the potential for aiding diagnostic processes in medical imaging.
This project exemplifies the application of deep learning in medical imaging, with potential uses in improving diagnostic workflows in healthcare
